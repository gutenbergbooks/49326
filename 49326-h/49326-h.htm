THE OSAGE TRIBE: TWO VERSIONS OF THE<br />
CHILD-NAMING RITE<br />
<br />
<small>By <span class="smcap">Francis La Flesche</span></small></p>

<hr class="chap" />

<h2 id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>

<p>The two versions of the Osage Child-naming Rite recorded in
this volume were obtained with considerable difficulty, owing to the
reluctance of the people to speak of the sacred rites that were formulated
by the Ni&acute;-ḳa Xu-be, Holy Men, of long ago. This unwillingness
to speak of the tribal rites, excepting in the prescribed
ceremonial way, arose from a sense of reverence for things sacred and
from the belief that within the rites, and in the articles dedicated
to religious use, there resides a mystic power which could punish, by
supernatural means, the persons who speak irreverently of the rites
and put to profane use the symbolic articles.</p>

<p>In the early part of the life of the Osage, according to tradition,
the people kept together for protection and moved about without
tribal or gentile organizations, a condition which they termed “gani&acute;-tha,”
which may be freely translated as, without law or order.</p>

<p>It was in those days that a group of men fell into the habit of
gathering together, from time to time, to exchange ideas concerning
the actions of the sun, moon, and stars which they observed move
within the sky with marvelous precision, each in its own given path.
They also noticed, in the course of their observations, that the
travelers in the upper world move from one side of the sky to the
other without making any disturbances in their relative positions,
and that with these great movements four changes take place in the
vegetal life of the earth which they agreed was effected by the actions
of some of the heavenly travelers. These seasonal changes they
named Be, Do-ge&acute;, Ṭoⁿ, and Ba&acute;-the (Spring, Summer, Autumn and
Winter).</p>

<p>The delving into the mysteries of the universe by this group of
men, which was carried on for a long period of time, was primarily
for the purpose of finding, if possible, the place from which comes
all life.</p>

<p>The seasonal changes upon the earth which appear to accompany
the movements of the sun and other cosmic bodies suggested to these
men the existence between sky and earth of a procreative relationship,
an idea which fixed itself firmly in their minds. It fitted their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
notion that the earth was related to and influenced by all of the great
bodies that move around within the sky. However, they were not
satisfied that these celestial bodies move without the guidance of
some governing power, and they continued their search and their
discussions. Then, in course of time, there crept into the minds of
these men, who became known as the “Little Old Men,” the thought
that a silent, invisible creative power pervades the sun, moon and
stars and the earth, gives to them life, and keeps them eternally in
motion and perfect order. This creative power which to their minds
was the source of life they named Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da, Mysterious Power,
and sometimes E-a&acute;-wa-woⁿ a-ka, The Causer of Our Being.</p>

<p>These ideas are given expression in that part of the child-naming
rite where the initiated members of two gentes are first called to enter
the house in which the ceremonies are to take place. One of these
gentes, the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge, Peaceful Ṭsi&acute;-zhu, represents the
sky with its sun, moon, and stars, and the other, the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi
Wa-shta-ge, Peaceful Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi, represents the earth with its
waters and dry land. The house itself then becomes a symbol of
the sky which encompasses the sun, moon, stars, and the earth.
Thus the house, the two gentes and all the others who enter it to take
part in the rite become, collectively, a symbol of the universe wherein
life manifests itself by taking on an infinite variety of bodily forms.
The whole ceremony is an expression of a longing desire that Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da
who dwells in the universe will favor the little one who is
to be named with a long life and an endless line of descendants.</p>

<p>The men who recorded the two versions of the Osage child-naming
rite were typical full-blood Indians, neither of them spoke the English
language, and nothing in all that they have given suggests foreign
influence. Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi (pl. 1) was a man of an inquiring mind.
He did not hesitate to ask of his initiators the meaning of the parts of
the rituals which he did not fully understand. He learned much
from his father, who was well versed in the ancient tribal rites.</p>

<p>Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ (pl. 2) did not have these advantages, but he had
a retentive mind and what he committed to memory of the rites was
sufficient to him. He did not insist upon being informed as to the
meaning of the parts of the rites that were obscure to him.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Mr. Vince Dillon, of Fairfax, Okla., for permitting
me to use a photograph he had made of two little Osages showing
symbolic hair cut of one of them. Also to Joe Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ for
the loan of a photograph of his two daughters. Joe is the son of
Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, who recorded the second version of the child-naming
ceremony.</p>

<h2 id="CHILD-NAMING_RITUALS">CHILD-NAMING RITUALS</h2>

<p>To a self-respecting Osage husband and wife, the ceremonial naming
of their first three sons and their first three daughters is of the utmost
importance. The couple regard the performing of the ceremony as
a sacred duty to their children which must never be neglected.</p>

<p>Each of these sons and daughters must be named according to the
rites prescribed by the ancient Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga. Until the ceremonial
naming the child has no place in the gentile organization,
and it is not even regarded as a person.</p>

<p>Every one of these three sons and three daughters has a special
kinship term which can be used only by the father, the mother, and
the nearest relatives. These special kinship terms, as observed in
their sequence, are as follows:</p>

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Sons</th>
    <th>Daughters</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;.</td>
    <td>Mi&acute;-noⁿ.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kshoⁿ&acute;-ga.</td>
    <td>Wi&acute;-he.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ḳa&acute;-zhiⁿ-ga.</td>
    <td>&Ccedil;i&acute;-ge or A-&ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-ga.</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>All the sons born after the third one are Ḳa&acute;-zhiⁿ-ga, and all the
daughters born after the third one, &Ccedil;i&acute;-ge or A-&ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-ga.</p>

<p>To each of the first six children belongs a distinctive gentile personal
name, spoken of as: iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute; zha-zhe (Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute; name),
mi&acute;-noⁿ zha-zhe (Mi&acute;-noⁿ name), etc. These names must always be
ceremonially conferred upon the newly born child. All the other
sons and daughters are named without any formality because the
ceremony performed for the Ḳa&acute;-zhiⁿ-ga and the &Ccedil;i&acute;-ge serves for
the other children that may follow. These distinctive gentile
names may be designated as gentile birth names.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="BIRTH_NAMES_OF_THE_PUMA_GENS">BIRTH NAMES OF THE PUMA GENS</h2>

<p>The gentile birth names of the Puma gens, as given by Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi,
are as follows:</p>

<h3 id="The_first_three_sons"><span class="smcap">The First Three Sons</span></h3>

<p>1. Mi&acute;-wa-ga-xe, Child-of-the-sun. This name is commemorative
of the talk that took place between the “Little Ones” and the
Sun when they went to him to ask for aid as they were about to come
to the earth, their future home. In asking for aid, the “Little Ones”
addressed the Sun as grandfather, and the Sun, in reply, said to
them: “It is true that you are my children.” Hence the name,
Mi&acute;-wa-ga-xe, Child-of-the-sun. The name is mentioned in the
Naming Ritual of the Puma gens. (See p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, lines 24 to 27.)</p>

<p>2. I&acute;-e-&ccedil;ka-wa-the, Giver-of-speech. The Sun also gave to the
“Little Ones” the power of expressing their thoughts by speech,
and the skill in arranging their words so that they can be clearly
understood. When a person speaks intelligently he is spoken of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
as i&acute;-e-wa-&ccedil;ka, a clear speaker. The children are given the name
I&acute;-e-&ccedil;ka-wa-the as a recognition of this great gift from the Sun.
The name is mentioned in the Naming Ritual of the Puma gens.
(See p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, line 34.)</p>

<p>The story of the introduction of this name, as told by the Black
Bear gens in their Ni&acute;-ḳi Ritual, differs from the Puma version of the
story. (See p. 228, 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., lines 238 to
304.)</p>

<p>3. Moⁿ&acute;-ga-xe, Arrow-maker. At the same time that the Sun
gave to the “Little Ones” the gift of speech he gave to them a finished
arrow so that when they came to dwell upon the earth they
could make arrows like it and use them for defending themselves
against enemies and for killing animals to use for food. The name
is mentioned in the Puma Naming Ritual. (See p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, line 44.)</p>

<h3 id="The_first_three_daughters"><span class="smcap">The First Three Daughters</span></h3>

<p>1. Moⁿ&acute;-ca-ṭse-xi, Sacred Arrowshaft. The name Moⁿ&acute;-ca-ṭse-xi
refers to the ray of light which was given by the Sun to the “Little
Ones” for use as an arrowshaft. This shaft had the quality of unerring
precision which excited the wonder of the “Little Ones.” It
was to them a mysterious arrowshaft. The name is mentioned in
the Naming Ritual of the Puma gens. (See p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, line 29.)</p>

<p>2. Moⁿ-zhoⁿ&acute;-op-she-wiⁿ, Woman-who-travels-over-the-earth.
This name refers to the ever recurring westward movement of the
moon over the earth. The name is mentioned in the Naming Ritual
of the Puma gens. (See p. <a href="#Page_41">41</a>, line 39.)</p>

<p>3. Noⁿ&acute;-mi-ṭse-xi, Beloved-child-of-the-sun. This name is mentioned
in the Naming Ritual of the Puma gens. (See p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, line 49.)</p>

<p>Another name follows that of the third son in the ritual, Iⁿ-shta&acute;-sha-be,
Dark-eyes, and is a Ḳa&acute;-zhiⁿ-ga name. The name is mentioned
in the Naming Ritual of the Puma gens. (See p. <a href="#Page_42">42</a>, line 54.)</p>

<p>The name E-noⁿ&acute;-gi-tha-bi, The Favorite, follows that of the third
daughter, and is a &Ccedil;i&acute;-ge name. This name is not mentioned in the
ritual. Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi said the fourth daughter is the favored one
because if the first three should fail to bring forth children the parents
would cherish the hope that their fourth daughter will give them
grandchildren.</p>

<h3 id="Sky_names"><span class="smcap">Sky Names</span></h3>

<p>The distinctive birth names of the Puma gens, mentioned above,
are spoken of as sky names, to distinguish them from the common
gentile names. These birth names are said to have originated in the
sky when the “Little Ones” were about to descend to the earth to
take upon themselves bodily form. Some of these names refer to
important events that came to pass before the descent from the sky
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
to the earth. Earth names were also used by both the Puma and the
Black Bear gentes. These names will be referred to later.</p>

<p>Every Osage gens has its own version of the tribal Child-naming
Ritual. The versions belonging to the Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga (Puma) gens of
the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division and that belonging to the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great
division have been secured and are given below in detail.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<h2 id="CHILD-NAMING_RITUAL_OF_THE_PUMA_GENS">CHILD-NAMING RITUAL OF THE PUMA GENS<br />

<small>(<span class="smcap">Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi</span>)</small></h2>

<p>When a man of the Puma gens is prepared for the ceremonial
naming of his newly born son he sends for the Sho&acute;-ḳa (official messenger)
of his gens. On the arrival of the Sho&acute;-ḳa the father puts
before him his customary fee of a blanket or blue cloth and a little
pipe which he must carry as his official badge. The father of the
child then orders the Sho&acute;-ḳa to go and call the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of
the Puma, the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge, and the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge
gentes. The Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge is the Peace gens of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
great tribal division, and the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge the Peace gens
of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great tribal division. Prominence was given, in this
ceremony, to these two gentes because they are the favored people of
the sun and the unclouded sky, the most sacred of the cosmic forces.
Through these two favored gentes the blessings of peace and long life
are invoked for the child to be named and formally given its place in
the tribal unit.</p>

<p>The Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of these three gentes assemble in the evening
at the house of the father who, in a formal speech, makes known to
them the purpose of the summons. Then the heads of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-shta-ge and the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge gentes direct the Sho&acute;-ḳa
to go and call the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the following gentes to assemble
at the house of the father on the next morning:</p>

<p>Hoⁿ&acute;-ga A-hiu-ṭoⁿ, Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be-ṭoⁿ and the O&acute;-poⁿ, of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga
subdivision; Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge, Ho&acute; I-ni-ḳa-shi-ga, Wa-zha&acute;-zhe
&Ccedil;ka and the Ṭa&acute; I-ni-ḳa-shi-ga of the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe subdivision;
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge, Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ, Mi-k’iⁿ&acute; Wa-noⁿ and the
Tho&acute;-xe of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division.</p>

<p>The Sho&acute;-ḳa, as he goes on this errand, does not neglect the little
pipe, his official badge.</p>

<h3 id="Ceremony_of_Decorating_the_Xo-ka"><span class="smcap">Ḳi&acute;-no<sup>N</sup>—Ceremony of Decorating the Xo&acute;-ḳa</span></h3>

<p>Before sunrise of the following day the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the Puma
gens assemble at the house of the member who had been appointed by
the father to act as Xo&acute;-ḳa in the ceremony. When all the members
had taken their places the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa (master of ceremonies)
recites the wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the symbolic articles with which the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Xo&acute;-ḳa is to be decorated. The wi&acute;-gi-e is accompanied by certain
ceremonial acts performed by an assistant. The first section of the
wi&acute;-gi-e relates to the red dawn, the beginning of the life of day.
The assistant, who has put red paint on the palms of his hands,
spreads them out toward the dawn that is reddening the eastern sky.
When the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa reaches the fourth line the assistant paints
red the face of the Xo&acute;-ḳa. Then, as the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa goes on
to the second section the assistant takes up a white, downy feather
(pl. 3, <i>b</i>), taken from the under covert of an eagle’s tail, and holds it
poised over the Xo&acute;-ḳa’s head. When the twelfth line of the wi&acute;-gi-e
is reached the assistant quickly fastens the feather to the scalplock
of the Xo&acute;-ḳa. This feather symbolizes one of the two white shafts
of light that may be seen at either side of the sun as it rises through
the fading color of the dawn. Each of these two shafts symbolizes
a never-ending life. The one at the right belongs to the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga
great division and the one at the left to the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division.
At the beginning of the third section of the wi&acute;-gi-e the assistant rubs
in the palms of his hands a bit of buffalo fat, then holds his outspread
hands poised over the Xo&acute;-ḳa’s head. When the twentieth line is
reached he anoints the Xo&acute;-ḳa’s hair with the oil, an act by which
is expressed the wish that the child whom the Xo&acute;-ḳa represents
shall always be abundantly supplied with food of all kinds.</p>

<p>At the fourth section of the wi&acute;-gi-e the assistant takes up a necklace
of beads, or a narrow woven band, to which is attached a shell
gorget (pl. 3, <i>a</i>) and holds it in readiness. When the twenty-sixth
line is reached he puts the necklace upon the neck of the Xo&acute;-ḳa so
that the gorget hangs upon his breast. This gorget typifies the Sun,
whose life endures forever.</p>

<p>As the ceremony of decorating the Xo&acute;-ḳa goes on, the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga
members of the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge gens, followed, by
those of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens, go to the house of the father
of the child to be named, and enter to take their places, those of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi at the east end on the south side and those of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu at the east end on the north side. (Fig. 1.) The house
then becomes the home of these two gentes for the time being and
for the purposes of the ceremony. The Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi is the Peace
gens of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great tribal division, its life symbol is the water
portion of the earth. The hereditary chief of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga division
was chosen from this gens. The Ṭsi&acute;-zhu is the Peace gens of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division. Its life symbol is the clear blue sky. The
hereditary chief of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division was chosen from this
gens.</p>

<h3 id="Tsi_Ta-pe"><span class="smcap">Ṭsi Ṭa&acute;-p̣e (Approach to the House)</span></h3>

<p>The purpose of the Ḳi&acute;-noⁿ ceremony is to prepare the Xo&acute;-ḳa
who represents the child to be named to approach in the prescribed
manner the house wherein sit the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi
and the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu gentes, the first representing the life-giving power
of water and the latter the life-giving power of the sun whose abode
is in the great blue sky. The Xo&acute;-ḳa is to come to the sacred house
as a suppliant for a full and complete life, uninterrupted by diseases
or accidents, and for an endless line of descendants. The ceremonial
approach of the Xo&acute;-ḳa to the sacred house is called Ṭsi
Ṭa&acute;-p̣e (Ṭsi, house; Ṭa&acute;-p̣e, approach), as to a place of refuge.</p>

to the sacred house, following his Sho&acute;-ḳa who precedes him in the
march. After the manner of all suppliants who approach Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da,
the Xo&acute;-ḳa carries with him a little pipe with which to make a smoke
offering to that mysterious power that controls all life. The Xo&acute;-ḳa
and the Sho&acute;-ḳa, on their solemn approach to the House of Mystery,
keep a certain distance apart. When they have gone some 40 or 50
paces they make a pause and the Xo&acute;-ḳa sings the following song,
after which he recites the first section of the wi&acute;-gi-e called Wa&acute;-&ccedil;i-thu-&ccedil;e
Wi&acute;-gi-e (Footstep Wi&acute;-gi-e). The song precedes each of the
four sections of the wi&acute;-gi-e:

<p>The words of the processional song:</p>

<span class="i0">Into my star you have cast yourself, etc.<br /></span>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
are addressed to the child upon whom is to be conferred his personal,
gentile name, and who is to be given his place in the Puma gens into
which he was born. The star referred to in the song is the sun, the
greatest life symbol of the Puma gens.</p>

<p>In the first section of the “Footstep Wi&acute;-gi-e,” which the Xo&acute;-ḳa
recites as he makes his processional approach to the House of Mystery,
the sun is referred to as the “Male Star.” The first line of the
wi&acute;-gi-e, “Toward what shall the little ones take their footsteps,”
implies that much thought was given by the ancient Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga
to the question as to the places where prayers for aid for the attainment
of long life should be directed. The lines that follow imply
that the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga had finally arrived at the belief that if the
“Little Ones” go with their prayers to the “Male Star,” the sun, they
would find the way by which they could reach old age. The authors
of these peculiar rites in speaking of long life did not only mean the
attainment of old age by the child but they also meant the continuity
of its life by procreation.</p>

<p>In the second section of the wi&acute;-gi-e the moon is referred to as the
“Female Star.” The same form that is used for the sun is also used
for the moon. The pairing of these two great cosmic bodies in this
wi&acute;-gi-e suggests a procreative relationship between the two. The
last two sections of the wi&acute;-gi-e are repetitions of the first two. These
repetitions are made in order to complete the mystic number four.
The moon, referred to in the second section as the female star, is the
life symbol of the Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be, or the Black Bear gens.</p>

<p>When the Xo&acute;-ḳa have finished reciting the first section of the Footstep
Wi&acute;-gi-e, which speaks of the approach of the little ones to the
sun, he and the Sho&acute;-ḳa continue their march. Again they pause and
the Xo&acute;-ḳa recites the second section which tells of the approach of
the little ones toward the moon seeking for long life. The fourth
pause brings them to the door of the House of Mystery, which they
enter, followed by the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa and the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of
the Puma gens who are to give their child a place in the visible
universe. They take their place at the east end of the lodge where sit
the father and mother with the child. The Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga who had
been called to take part in the ceremony also enter and take their
fixed places, those belonging to the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division at the south
side and those of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division at the north side of the
lodge. (Fig. 1.)</p>

<h3 id="The_Wa-the-the_ceremony"><span class="smcap">The Wa-the&acute;-the Ceremony</span></h3>

<p>When all the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga have become settled in their places,
according to gentes, the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa proceeds with the ceremonial
acts called Wa-the&acute;-the, which, translated literally, means,
The Sending; that is, the sending of a fee of a blanket or other article
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
of value to each, head of the gentes taking part in the child-naming
ceremony. It is understood by these ceremonial acts that the members
of the gens to whose head is sent a fee are requested to recite the
wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the Life Symbol of their gens. Each article is
received from the hands of the A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa by the Sho&acute;-ḳa who
delivers it to the head of the gens for whom it is sent.</p>

<p>Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi, who gives this child-naming ritual of his gens, the
Puma, when acting as A&acute;-ḳi-hoⁿ Xo&acute;-ḳa, sends the fees in the following
order:</p>

<p>Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge: Fee, with a red downy eagle feather, symbolizing
the sun. The members of the gens will recite their wi&acute;-gi-e
relating to the life-giving power of the sun. (See 36th Ann. Rept.
Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 124, lines 1 to 177.)</p>

<p>Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be: Fee; will recite the Zha&acute;-zhe Ḳi-ṭoⁿ Wi&acute;-gi-e, Name
Wi&acute;-gi-e of the gens. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 228,
lines 238 to 304.) The Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be and the Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga gentes are
closely related and one acts as Sho&acute;-ḳa for the other in their ceremonies
of initiation into the mysteries of the tribal rites.</p>

<p>Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ: Fee; will recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the life-giving
power of the sun, their life symbol. (See 36th Ann. Rept.
Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 118, lines 1 to 36.)</p>

<p>Hoⁿ&acute;-ga A-hiu-ṭoⁿ: Fee; will recite wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the mottled
eagle, the “stainless” bird that led the people down from the sky
to the earth. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 162, lines
177 to 311.)</p>

<p>Mi-k’iⁿ&acute; Wa-noⁿ: Fee; the members of this gens will recite their
wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the moon and all the stars and to their power to
aid the “little ones” to reach old age. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur.
Amer. Ethn., p. 122, lines 1 to 44.)</p>

<p>O&acute;-poⁿ: Fee; the members of the gens will recite the Wa-dsu-ṭa
I-hi-thoⁿ-be Wi&acute;-gi-e which tells of the various places of the earth
where the little ones may find the animals on which to live. (See
36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 112, lines 1 to 109.)</p>

<p>Tho&acute;-xe: Fee; some grains of maize are also sent. The members
of this gens will recite the wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the bringing of the
maize to the people by a buffalo bull, and to his offer to aid the
little ones to reach old age. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn.,
p. 280, lines 83 to 110; also p. 134, lines 1 to 162.)</p>

<p>Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge: Fee, with cedar fronds. Members of
this gens will recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the red cedar, an evergreen
tree which has power to resist death, and to its offer to aid the
little ones to reach old age. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn.,
p. 95, lines 1 to 34.)</p>

<p>Ho&acute; I-ni-ḳa-shi-ga: Fee, with a kettle of water. The members
of this gens will recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the everflowing water
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
which, has power to help the little ones to reach old age. These are
the Fish people. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 98,
lines 1 to 35.)</p>

<p>Wa-zha&acute;-zhe &ccedil;ka: Fee, with a mussel shell. The mussel is the
life symbol of this gens. The members of the gens will recite their
wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the power of the mussel to resist death, and to
its consent to aid the little ones to reach old age. The Wa-zha&acute;-zhe
&ccedil;ka are a water people. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn.,
p. 94, lines 1 to 29.)</p>

<p>Ṭa I-ni-ḳa-shi-ga, the Deer People: Only a fee is sent to them.
The members will recite their Wa-dsu&acute;-ṭa I-hi-thoⁿ-be Wi&acute;-gi-e,
which tells of the various places of the earth where the deer will
reveal themselves to the little ones to give them help to reach old
age. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 97, lines 44 to 103.)</p>

<p>When the Sho&acute;-ḳa had delivered the last fee every Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga
who knows his wi&acute;-gi-e begins to recite it in a loud voice. None of the
wi&acute;-gi-es are alike and none of the members of a gens recite in unison,
consequently there would be a volume of sounds most bewildering
to the uninitiated.</p>

<h3 id="Zha-zhe_ki-ton_Wi-gi-e"><span class="smcap">Zha&acute;-zhe Ḳi-ṭo<sup>N</sup> Wi&acute;-gi-e</span></h3>

<p>The wi&acute;-gi-e recited by the members of the Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga gens at
this time is called Zha&acute;-zhe Ḳi-ṭoⁿ Wi&acute;-gi-e, freely translated, the
Name Wi&acute;-gi-e. It is in three parts. The first, which includes sections
1 to 8, is called Zha&acute;-zhe Ḳi-ṭoⁿ, the taking of names; the second,
which includes sections 9 and 10, is called U&acute;-noⁿ U-tha-ge, the
telling of the means by which to reach old age; the third, which
includes sections 11 and 12, is called U&acute;-noⁿ-bthe U-gi-dse, the story
of the search for the life-giving foods.</p>

<p>When Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi made up his mind to give a description of the
Child-naming Ritual of his own gens, the Puma, he did not hesitate
to recite the wi&acute;-gi-es and to tell of the ceremonial forms that accompany
the entire ritual. But when asked to recite the wi&acute;-gi-es
of the 11 gentes who were summoned to take part in the ceremony of
conferring a name upon a Puma child he declined to give them,
although he knew all of them, for the reason that they were not his
to give. He had not obtained from any of these gentes the right to
transfer them to strangers or to members of other gentes.</p>

<p>It so happened that when Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi was describing the Child-naming
Ritual of his own gens, which he had a perfect right to do, Wa-sho&acute;-she
(pl. 4), a member of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga A-hiu-ṭoⁿ gens, was present.
This man, when asked if he would be willing to give the U&acute;-noⁿ
Wi&acute;-gi-e (Old-age Wi&acute;-gi-e) of his gens for a fee, promptly replied that
he would. He had obtained by purchase from his father the wi&acute;-gi-e
and so had acquired the right to transfer it to anybody, but the transfer
must always be made for a fee. The fee was provided and Wa-sho&acute;-she

mottled eagle, who conducted the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga people to earth from mid-heaven.

<p>The first seven lines of the wi&acute;-gi-e refer back to the time when
“the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga who possess seven fireplaces” chose for one of their
life symbols the “Stainless Bird,” the mottled eagle. The people
who are here spoken of as the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga having seven fireplaces are
those who compose the seven gentile groups that represent the land
portion of the earth in the two great tribal divisions symbolizing
the cosmos. These seven gentile groups (seven fireplaces) are, as
given by Black-dog. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp.
52-53.)</p>

<p>A bowl of shelled corn, the life symbol of the Tho&acute;-xe gens, was
also placed before the head of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens. (For
the Maize Wi&acute;-gi-e of the Tho&acute;-xe gens, see 36th Ann. Rept. Bur.
Amer. Ethn., p. 135, lines 57 to 113; also p. 277, lines 83 to 110.)</p>

<p>When the bowls of water and cedar fronds and shelled corn are
placed before the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge, the Sho&acute;-ḳa puts in his arms
the child to be blessed and named. The head of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge
gens then passes the tips of the fingers of his right hand over
the bowl of water and cedar fronds, and the bowl of the life-giving
corn, then touches with the tips of his fingers the lips, head, arms
and body of the child. The two bowls and the child are then passed
on to the head of the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi Wa-shta-ge gens, who goes through
the same motions with the child. The child and the two bowls are
then passed on to the heads of each of the other gentes who
make the same motions over the child as were made by the heads
of the first two gentes.</p>

<p>These ceremonial acts performed by the heads of the gentes
officiating, by which the child is brought into touch with the ever-flowing
waters, the red cedar, an everlasting tree, and the life-giving
corn, are supplicatory acts by which the aid of Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da is sought
for the child who is to go forth to take part in the great life activities.
Not only is the attainment of old age desired for the child but also
the continuity of its life by a never-ending line of descendants.</p>

<p>At the close of these ceremonial acts a sacred gentile name is conferred
upon the child without further ceremony. If, however, there
are two or more names to choose from, as is the case in some of the
gentes, the mother of the child has the privilege of making a choice
from two or three names. This privilege is given by the Xo&acute;-ḳa,
who offers to the mother two small sticks prepared for this purpose,
each of which represents a name mentioned in the origin ritual of
the gens naming the child. The mother usually chooses the stick
representing the name which to her has the greater religious significance
and is the most euphonious.</p>

<h3 id="Earth_names_and_wi-gi-es"><span class="smcap">Earth Names and Wi&acute;-gi-es</span></h3>

<p>It was stated (see p. 33) that earth names as well as sky names
were used by both the Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga and the Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be gentes as distinctive
birth names for their children.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<p>In the course of a conversation concerning the gentile names,
classed as sky and earth names, Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi, of the Puma gens,
remarked that: When the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga people were coming from the sky
to the earth they chose two persons (gentes) to act as official messengers.
One of these persons was called Hoⁿ&acute;-ga Wa&acute;-ṭse-gi-ṭsi,
The-sacred-one-from-the-stars, and the other Hoⁿ&acute;-ga Wa-ṭse-ga-wa,
The-sacred-radiant-star. These messengers were expected to find
some way of dispersing the waters that submerged the earth and
of exposing the ground beneath so as to make it habitable for all
living creatures.</p>

<p>Wa&acute;-ṭse-gi-ṭsi and Wa&acute;-ṭse-ga-wa, the two messengers, found on the
still waters the water spider, the water beetle, the white leech, and
the dark leech, of whom they asked for aid which they could not give,
but promised to help the people to reach old age. (See 36th Ann.
Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 163, lines 200 to 273.) The two messengers
went on and they met O&acute;-poⁿ-ṭoⁿ-ga, the Great Elk, and
appealed to him for aid. The Great Elk threw himself upon the
waters four times and splashed about until the ground was exposed
and ready to receive men and animals. He then called to the four
corners of the earth for the life-giving winds to come. Next he threw
himself upon the ground and rolled about; then, as he arose, the
hairs of his body clung to the soil and became the grasses of the
earth. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 165-167, lines
274 to 354.)</p>

<p>The two messengers then led the people over the dry land of the
earth, when suddenly Hoⁿ&acute;-ga Wa&acute;-ṭse-gi-ṭsi, The-one-from-the-stars,
came upon Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga, the Puma. The messenger then changed
his name from Wa&acute;-ṭse-gi-ṭsi to Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga. In like manner the
Hoⁿ&acute;-ga Wa&acute;-ṭse-ga-wa, the Radiant Star, came upon Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be, the
Black Bear. The Radiant Star then changed his name from Wa&acute;-ṭse-ga-wa
to Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be, the Black Bear.</p>

<p>These were the first earth names of the two related gentes, the
Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga and the Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be. Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi mentioned several
other personal earth names of these two gentes but he suggested that
the parts of the rituals given by himself and Wa-ṭse&acute;-moⁿ-iⁿ (pl. 5), in
which are mentioned the earth names, be referred to as authoritative,
and so the following paraphrases of those parts of the rituals are
here given.</p>

<p>Mi&acute;-xa-&ccedil;ka, the white swan from whom personal names were taken,
as mentioned in the following wi&acute;-gi-e given by Wa-ṭse&acute;-moⁿ-iⁿ, is a
warrior symbol. The black color on its feet and on the tip of its
nose typifies the fire that knows no mercy. The standards (crooks),
which were carried by an Osage war party (pl. 6, <i>a</i>), typify the neck
of the white swan.</p>

either by himself or by Wa-ṭse&acute;-moⁿ-iⁿ. However, the Mysterious-hand
is spoken of by both of these men in their conversations concerning
the rites, and is referred to in some of the wi&acute;-gi-es. (See
36th Ann. Rept., p. 230, lines 323 to 340.) The story of the Mysterious-hand,
as told colloquially, is that when the people came from
the sky to the earth they had no weapons, but they killed animals by
moistening the index finger of the right hand with saliva and pointing
it at them. This name is also bestowed ceremonially.</p>

<h3 id="Special_instructions_to_the_mother"><span class="smcap">Special Instructions to the Mother</span></h3>

<p>At the close of the ceremony of blessing the child by the various
gentes officiating, the Sho&acute;-ḳa conducts the mother to a seat prepared
for her in front of the Xo&acute;-ḳa, who gives her special instructions
in the ceremonies to be observed by her to complete the child-naming
rite. Between the two is spread a buffalo robe which had
been decorated with certain symbolic designs. (Fig. 2.) This
formal talk to the mother is called “Ḳi&acute;-noⁿ U-tha-ge,” Telling of
the Symbolic Painting. Extra fees are required for the special
instruction, which, with the help of friends and relatives, the mother
is enabled to pay.</p>

<div class="figleft w50">
<img id="FIG_2" src="images/fig_2.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Symbolic robe prepared for children</p>
</div>

<p>If the mother is skilled with her awl and thread in ornamental
work she would decorate with porcupine quills the symbolic robe
to be used in this special ceremony;
if not skilled, she would content herself
with painting the symbolic designs on
the robe.</p>

<p>When the robe has been spread
before the Xo&acute;-ḳa he begins to talk,
as follows:</p>

<p>Wi-ṭsi-ni-e&acute;, My daughter-in-law, I
see you have brought with you a robe
which you have dressed and decorated
for the comfort of your little one. It
is a sacred robe which should be put
to use with proper ceremony. This
ceremony you will observe for a period
of four days, during which you will
paint red the parting or your hair.
It will be a sign that you appeal for a long and fruitful life for yourself
and child, to the god of day whose path lies over the middle of
the earth.</p>

<p>You have reddened the head and the forelegs of the robe. The
head and forelegs of the robe typify that part of the earth whence
rises the god of day to take his westward journey. Red is the color
of the day when it is young, the time when you will rise and go forth
to prepare food for the little one whose tender life is wholly dependent
upon your efforts. A narrow line runs from the head of the robe
along the middle of the back to the tail. This line typifies the path
of the god of day who ever travels from east to west. Midway of
the path is a round spot which represents the god of day when it
has reached the middle of heaven. Here he marks the time when
you will turn your thoughts from other things to the feeding of the
little one so that the nourishing of its life may be continuous. The
god of day continues his journey and in time reaches the edge of
the earth, behind which he finally disappears. The hind legs and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
the tail of the robe are reddened to typify the glow that warns us
of the ending of the day when your thoughts will again turn to the
care of the little one. When you put these symbolic marks upon
this sacred robe your thoughts reached out in appeal to Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da
for yourself and child.</p>

</div>

<p>As the shadow of night spreads over the land you will take your
little one in your arms, draw this robe over you, then rest in sleep.
The robe which you draw over yourself and child typifies the
heaven, whence comes all life, and the act is an appeal to heaven for
protection.</p>

<p>The procuring of food for the little one should always be done
with a feeling of gratitude toward the Mysterious Power that brings
forth life in all forms. There is a plant which is dedicated to use
as a sacred food in the bringing up of the little ones, known as ṭse&acute;-wa-the
(<i>Nelumbo lutea</i>) (pl. 6, <i>b</i>). (36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer.
Ethn., p. 183, lines 910 to 923.) You will at times go to the lake
to gather the roots of this plant for use in feeding your little one.
When about to go to the lake you will paint red the parting of
your hair, as a sign of your gratitude to the god of day who passes
over your head and over the plant you go to seek, shedding his life-giving
power upon you as he goes upon his journey.</p>

<p>When you come to the edge of the lake you will look about for a
staff to support you as you work in the water. You will choose the
willow for your staff, for it is a tree that clings persistently to life.
By this act you will make an appeal to the great Life-giving Power
for a long and fruitful life for yourself and the little one. With the
willow staff in your hands you will step into the water and take up
from the soft earth beneath a root of the sacred plant, the ṭse&acute;-wa-the.
You will find clinging to the root some of the soft earth from which
the plant draws nourishment and strength. Take this bit of soil and
touch your forehead and body with it, an act which will be as a sign
that you appeal to the earth wherein there is Life-giving Power.
When you have performed this act return the root to the earth
beneath the water, with the wish that the plant shall forever be
plentiful. Then gather enough of the roots to satisfy the little one
and yourself.</p>

<p>The maize is another sacred life-giving plant. You raise this
plant from year to year. When you prepare the ground for planting
the seed you will take one grain and put it in a hill, you will
press down upon it the soil with your foot, and say: “My father-in-law
bade me do this, as an expression of my faith that the sky and
the earth will yield to me not only one ear of maize but one animal
as well, or even one herd of animals.” In the next hill you will put
two grains, in the next three, the next four, the next five, the next
six, and in the seventh seven, always repeating the words at each
planting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span></p>

<p>The ceremony closes with the end of the special instructions given
to the mother of the child blessed and named, and as each member
of the gentes who had taken part in the rite rises to go he makes
some pleasant remarks to the father and the mother.</p>

<p>When the mother goes to her field to plant the seeds of the maize
she remembers the instructions and follows them in every detail.
As the maize matures and the ears are still green and tender the
mother cuts the stalks from the hills she had ceremonially made,
leaving the ears on the stalks. She ties the stalks in bundles, and,
with the aid of friends, carries them home to her house. She then
prepares a feast to which she invites the man who had acted as
Xo&acute;-ḳa at the ceremonial naming of her child. He in turn invites
some of his friends who had acted as Xo&acute;-ḳa in child-naming ceremonies
to come and share in the feast prepared for him.</p>

<p>If among the invited guests there happens to be a member of the
Tho&acute;-xe gens, learned in the rituals, he is requested by the honored
guest to recite the maize wi&acute;-gi-e of his gens.</p>

<p>A paraphrase is here given of the wi&acute;-gi-e which the Tho&acute;-xe recite
to give pleasure to the host and to the guests. The mythical story
points to mid-heaven as the region of the conception of life forms,
and as the starting point of the Osage people in their journey to
earth, the region of actual birth into bodily existence.</p>

<p>The feasting of the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga upon the fruits of the seeds
of the maize planted by the mother with religious care in the seven
sacred hills completes the rite of the naming of her child, by which
its right to a place in its gens is formally recognized; the child has a
place, not only in its gens, but also in the sky and the earth which the
two great tribal divisions, the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga and the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu, represent.

<h2 id="CHILD-NAMING_RITUAL_OF_THE_TSI_-ZHU_WA-SHTA-GE">CHILD-NAMING RITUAL OF THE ṬSI&acute;-ZHU WA-SHTA-GE
GENS<br />

<small>(<span class="smcap">Sho<sup>N</sup>&acute;-ge-mo<sup>N</sup>-i<sup>N</sup></span>)</small></h2>

<p>The Child-naming ritual of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens of the
Osage tribe, here recorded, was given by Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, a member
of the Ba&acute;-po subgens of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens. The name
Ba&acute;-po (Popper in English), Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ explained, is the name
of the elder tree, the trunk of which boys, from time reaching beyond
memory, used for making poppers. The name refers to a mythical
story and to a ceremonial office. The mythical story is as follows:
When the people of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division descended from the
sky to make the earth their home they came down as eagles, and they
alighted on a great red oak tree. The shock of their alighting
caused the acorns to drop from the tree in great profusion, which
was taken as a prophecy that the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu would become a numerous
people. One eagle was crowded off the tree, but as he dropped down
he alighted upon a blossoming elder tree. This eagle was a peace
bird and his alighting on the ba&acute;-po tree made it to become a peace
symbol. The Ba&acute;-po subgens was given the office of furnishing a
pipestem for the peace pipe in the keeping of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge
gens, and the Ba&acute;-po made the stem of an elder sapling a
symbol of peace.</p>

<p>When Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ is called by a member of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-shta-ge gens to act as Xo&acute;-ḳa (instructor) in the ceremonial
naming of his child he goes to the house of the father without any
formality. Usually the call is made when the sun is traveling downward
(afternoon); when he receives the message he promptly responds
to the call. On his arrival at the house the father, in a formal speech,
informs him that his summons was for the purpose of asking him to
conduct the ceremonies to be performed at the naming of his child.
When Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ gives his consent to officiate at the ceremony
the fees for the men who are to take part are placed before him.
These he examines to make sure that there are enough articles to go
around, and to see if the man had also provided a pipe for the Sho&acute;-ḳa
or Official Messenger.</p>

<h3 id="Certain_Gentes_Called_to_Take_Part_in_the_Ceremony"><span class="smcap">Certain Gentes Called to Take Part in the Ceremony</span></h3>

<p>Being satisfied that the man had supplied all the necessary articles,
he places in the hands of the father the ceremonial pipe and bids
him go after the Sho&acute;-ḳa of the gens. The father returns with the
messenger who was already invested with the little pipe, the badge
of his authority. When the two men had taken their seats Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
directs the Sho&acute;-ḳa to go and call the heads of the following
gentes, with their Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga members, to come to the house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of the father, at sunrise the next morning, to take part in the ceremonies
of naming his child:</p>

<p>1. Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi, of the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe subdivision, to recite their
wi&acute;-gi-e relating to their life symbol, the red cedar. (36th Ann.
Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 95, lines 1 to 34.)</p>

<p>2. Noⁿ&acute;-poⁿ-da, Deer gens, of the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe subdivision, to
recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to one of their life symbols, the water.
(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 98, lines 1 to 25.)</p>

<p>3. I&acute;-ba-ṭse Ṭa-dse, Wind People, of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga subdivision,
to recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to one of their life symbols, the maize.</p>

<p>4. Tho&acute;-xe, Buffalo-bull gens of the Ṭsi-zhu great division, to
recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the maize. Tho&acute;-xe is the gens that
gave to the people the maize and the squashes. (36th Ann. Rept.
Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 279, lines 54 to 110.) The Tho&acute;-xe authorized
the I&acute;-ba-ṭse and certain other gentes to use the Maize ritual in their
child-naming ceremonies.</p>

<p>5. &Ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse-a-gthe, Wolf gens of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division, to
recite their wi&acute;-gi-e relating to their life symbol, the sun. The Dog-star
is also one of their life symbols. (36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer.
Ethn., p. 118, lines 1 to 36.)</p>

<h3 id="Wa-zho-i-ga-the_Wi-gi-e"><span class="smcap">Wa-zho&acute;-i-ga-the (Life Symbol) Wi&acute;-gi-e</span></h3>

<p>The Sho&acute;-ḳa returns to the house of the father and reports that he
has given notice to all the gentes named to attend the ceremony.
Then Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ proceeds to recite the Wa-zho&acute;-i-ga-the Wi&acute;-gi-e
of his gens, a name which means, The Taking of Bodies; that is,
The Taking of Life Symbols. The reciting of this wi&acute;-gi-e is for the
benefit of the father and the child.</p>

him to the house of the child to be named. Upon receiving the

pouch from a bag containing his personal belongings and puts some
red paint on the inner surface of his hands. Then as the eastern
clouds take from the rising sun a crimson tinge, he lifts his hands,
palms outward, toward them and the sun itself. After a silent pause
he withdraws his hands and reddens his face with the paint on them,
as though with the color of the sun, and his messengers, the reddened
clouds. When he has put upon his face the sacred color he takes
from a package in which he keeps his ornamental feathers a red
downy eagle feather which he fastens to his scalplock so that the
red feather, the life symbol of his gens, stands firm and upright. In
the days when buffalo were plentiful the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga who is to
act as Xo&acute;-ḳa at the child-naming ceremony wore a buffalo robe
with the hair outside, but since the extinction of that animal he
substituted for the robe a woven blanket obtained from traders.</p>

<p>Having thus decorated himself with red paint and the red feather,
symbols of the sky, and the substitute of the buffalo robe, an earth
symbol, Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, now actual Xo&acute;-ḳa, goes forth to the house
of the child to be named, following the Sho&acute;-ḳa, who leads the way.
It was explained by the old man that the manner of approach of his
gens, the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge, to the house of the child was very
simple, that it did not have the elaborate ceremonial forms described
by Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi that were followed by his gens, the Puma, and the
other war gentes of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division.</p>

<p>Arriving at the house, the Sho&acute;-ḳa enters without pause and leads
the Xo&acute;-ḳa to his place at the left of the father, who sits with his wife
and child at the east end of the house. When the Xo&acute;-ḳa has taken
his seat the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of his gens, the Ṭsi-zhu Wa-shta-ge,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
enter and take their places back of the Xo&acute;-ḳa and the parents and
sit in a row occupying the entire width of the house. Then the
Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the other gentes who are to take part in the ceremony
enter, those of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division taking their accustomed
places at the south side and those of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division
at the north side of the house. (Fig. 1.) Except for the blankets of
various colors, the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga were decorated alike, their
faces painted red, the color of the sun and the dawn, and a red
downy feather fastened to the scalplock of each one.</p>

<h3 id="A_life_symbol_sent_to_each_of_the_officiating_gentes"><span class="smcap">A Life Symbol Sent to Each of the Officiating Gentes</span></h3>

<p>When all the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga had settled down in their places, and
had exchanged with each other the usual social greetings, Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
opens the proceedings with a formal statement, setting forth
the purpose of the gathering and adding some pertinent remarks concerning
the ancient rite of naming the children and their formal
recognition as members of the tribe. He then goes on to the ceremony
of distributing the fees and the symbolic articles to be used in
the rite. The distribution was made in the following order:</p>

<p>1. To the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi, Star gens of the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe subdivision
of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division, he sent, by the Sho&acute;-ḳa, cedar fronds
with fee. The cedar is a life symbol of the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi gens.</p>

<p>2. To the Tho&acute;-xe, Buffalo-bull gens, of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great division,
a bowl of shelled corn with fee. The maize is one of the life symbols
of the Tho&acute;-xe.</p>

<p>3. To the Noⁿ&acute;-poⁿ-da, Deer gens of the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe subdivision
of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division, a bowl of water with fee. Water is one
of the life symbols of the Noⁿ&acute;-poⁿ-da.</p>

<p>4. To the &Ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse-a-gthe, Wolf-tail gens, of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great
division, fee only. The sun is one of the life symbols of this gens.
The Dog-star is also one of its symbols.</p>

<p>5. I&acute;-ba-ṭse Ṭa-dse, Wind gens of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga subdivision of the
Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division, a bowl of shelled corn. The Tho&acute;-xe authorized
the I&acute;-ba-ṭse to use the maize ritual. This gens also has the
office of performing the ceremonies by which the souls of warriors
slain in battle are sent direct to the spirit land.</p>

<h3 id="Gentes_recite_their_wi-gi-es_simultaneously"><span class="smcap">Members of the Officiating Gentes Recite Their Wi&acute;-gi-es
Simultaneously</span></h3>

<p>When the Sho&acute;-ḳa, the Ceremonial Messenger, had made the last
delivery of the symbolic articles and fees to the gentes above named,
each Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga begins to recite the wi&acute;-gi-e of his gens relating to
its life symbol, such as the cedar fronds, the corn or water. As each
Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga recites the wi&acute;-gi-e of his gens, old Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
recites the Name Wi&acute;-gi-e of his own gens, the Ṭsi-zhu Wa-shta-ge,
which is as follows:

<h3 id="The_child_is_passed_from_gens_to_gens_to_be_blessed"><span class="smcap">The Child is Passed from Gens to Gens to be Blessed</span></h3>

<p>At the close of the simultaneous recital of the wi&acute;-gi-es by the
Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the six gentes, namely, the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi, Tho&acute;-xe,
Noⁿ&acute;-poⁿ-da, &Ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse-a-gthe, I&acute;-ba-ṭse, and the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge,
the Sho&acute;-ḳa carries the infant to the head of the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi gens, who
takes it in his arms, then, dipping the tips of the fingers into a wooden
vessel, in which had been put sacred water and red cedar fronds, he
gently touches with his moistened fingertips the lips, head, arms, and
body of the little one. This ceremonial act is an appeal to Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da
to grant to the little one health and strength so that it may grow
to maturity and old age without interruption by disease.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span></p>

<p>The child is next taken by the Sho&acute;-ḳa to the head of the Noⁿ&acute;-poⁿ-da
gens, who blesses it in the same manner with the symbolic
water and cedar fronds.</p>

<p>Then the little one is taken to the head of the I&acute;-ba-ṭse gens, who
touches the lips, head, arms and body of the child with pounded corn,
besides the sacred water and cedar fronds. The touching of the
child with the life-giving corn is an act of appeal to Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da that
the child be not permitted to suffer for want of food during its life,
so that it may reach maturity and old age without difficulty. The
gentile symbol of the I&acute;-ba-ṭse gens is the wind but it was authorized
by the Tho&acute;-xe gens to use the corn ritual in its child-naming ritual.</p>

<p>The Sho&acute;-ḳa takes the little one from the I&acute;-ba-ṭse to the head of
the Tho&acute;-xe, Buffalo-bull, gens. In the mythical story of the origin
of the maize it was Tho&acute;-xe, Buffalo-bull, who gave to the people
the maize and the squash. (See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn.,
pp. 279-281, lines 54 to 110.) The head of the Tho&acute;-xe gens takes
the little one in his arms and blesses it with the sacred water and cedar
fronds as did the Wa&acute;-ṭse-ṭsi, then, mixing some of his own pounded
corn with that of the I&acute;-ba-ṭse, he blesses the child with the sacred
corn, the life symbol of his own gens. The ceremonial act of the
Tho&acute;-xe is an expression of the wish that the life-giving corn will aid
the new member of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens to successfully
reach maturity and old age.</p>

<p>The next to take the child in his arms and bless it with the symbolic
water, cedar fronds and corn is the head of the &Ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse-a-gthe,
Wolf, gens. His ceremonial acts do not differ from those of the
Tho&acute;-xe.</p>

<p>The Sho&acute;-ḳa then brings the little one to its own gens, the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-shta-ge, the People of Peace. The head of the gens takes the
little one in his arms and blesses it in the same manner in which the
Tho&acute;-xe blessed it. This is the gens to whom the sick are brought
that they might taste of the sacred food prepared by them and be
strengthened. From this healing power the members of the gens
like to take the name, Wa-stse&acute;-e-doⁿ, Good-doctor.</p>

<p>When each of these gentes had blessed the child in turn the Sho&acute;-ḳa
brings the mother to the Xo&acute;-ḳa, who places in her hands two little
sticks, each of which represents a sacred name of the gens of which
the little one has now become a member. The Xo&acute;-ḳa bids her
take one of the names represented by the sticks. The mother
usually takes for her child the name that is most euphonious and which
she thinks has the greater religious significance. The selection of a
name for the new member of the gens closes the ceremony.</p>

<p>During the month of April, 1916, Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ was summoned
to the house of Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi to name his grandson, whose father is
a member of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens. Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
promptly responded to the call but Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi became uncertain
as to whether or not the ceremonial naming of a child according to
the ancient tribal rites would come under the prohibition of the new
religion which he had accepted against the practice of the ancient
Osage ceremonies. The full ceremony was omitted, but the old man
was asked to offer to the mother the choice of two sacred names:
Moⁿ-zhoⁿ&acute;, Earth (see p. 70, line 45), and Wa-stse&acute;-e-doⁿ, Good-doctor.
The mother, a member of the Iⁿ-gthoⁿ&acute;-ga (Puma) gens,
chose for her son, a member of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens, the
name Wa-stse&acute;-e-doⁿ. Although the full child-naming ceremony
was omitted, Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi gave as fees to Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ a horse,
a blanket, and other articles of value, amounting to about one hundred
and fifty dollars.</p>

<p>The first wi&acute;-gi-e recited in the child-naming ritual given by Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
(pp. 60 to 67) is entitled Wa-zho&acute;-i-ga-the Wi&acute;-gi-e,
literally, The Taking of Bodies, and freely translated, The Taking
of Life Symbols. In this wi&acute;-gi-e eight gods, in the forms of certain
cosmic bodies, are adopted as Life Symbols. Sex is attributed to
these gods and goddesses and they are addressed as “grandfather”
and “grandmother” because of their great age and mysterious
character. The wi&acute;-gi-e is an expression by the ancient Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga
of their longing desire for a tribal life that will be as lasting
as that of the gods and goddesses who forever travel in the heavens.
These gods and goddesses are paired in this wi&acute;-gi-e as follows:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">1. Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da Hoⁿ&acute;-ba doⁿ, God of Day (the Sun), grandfather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">2. Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da Hoⁿ doⁿ, Goddess of Night (the Moon), grandmother.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">3. Wa&acute;-ṭse-do-ga, Male Star (the Morning star), grandfather,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">5. Wa&acute;-ba-ha, Litter (the Dipper), grandfather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">6. Ṭa-p̣a&acute;, Deer-head (the Pleiades), grandmother.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">7. Ṭa Tha&acute;-bthiⁿ, Three-deer (the three great stars that form Orion’s Belt), grandfather,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">8. Mi-ḳa-ḳ’e u-ḳi-tha-&ccedil;’iⁿ (Stars-strung-together) (theta and iota in Orion), grandmother.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Xu&acute;-tha-wa-ṭoⁿ-iⁿ of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ (Elder Ṭsi&acute;-zhu), a war
gens of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division, was asked for the Child-naming
Ritual of his gens, he being referred to as one versed in the
rituals of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu war gentes, but he declined to give it in full.
With some reluctance he consented to recite the first wi&acute;-gi-e of his
ritual which corresponds to and bears the same title as the one given
by Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, a Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge
gens. (See pp. 60 to 67.)

<p>In the Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ wi&acute;-gi-e (The Taking of Life Symbols), the
people of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens implored four gods and four
goddesses of the sky for permission to take from them “bodies” for
their little ones. The people
of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ,
in the wi&acute;-gi-e recorded by
Xu-thu&acute;-wa-ṭoⁿ-iⁿ, entreated
six gods and four goddesses
of the sky for permission
to take “bodies”
from them for their little
ones. The following is the
order in which the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-noⁿ people approached
these ten sky deities, the
order in which they paired them according to sex, and the terms of
relationship they used in addressing them:</p>

<p>1. Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da Hoⁿ&acute;-ba doⁿ, the God of Day (the Sun), grandfather,<br />
2. Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da Hoⁿ doⁿ, the Goddess of Night (the Moon), grandmother.</p>

<p>3. Mi-ḳa&acute;-ḳ’e Hoⁿ-baⁿ doⁿ, the Day-star (Morning star), grandfather,<br />
4. Mi-ḳa&acute;-ḳ’e Hoⁿ&acute; doⁿ, the Night-star (Evening star), grandmother.</p>

<p>5. Wa&acute;-ba-ha, Litter, the Dipper (Great Bear), (fig. 3), grandfather,<br />
6. Mi-ḳa&acute;-ḳ’e u-ḳi-tha-&ccedil;’iⁿ, Double-star, grandmother.</p>

<p>7. Ṭa-p̣a&acute;, Deer-head, Pleiades, grandfather,<br />
8. Ṭa Tha&acute;-bthiⁿ, Three-deer, the three great stars in Orion’s belt (fig. 4), grandmother.</p>

<p>9. Mi-ḳa&acute;-ḳ’e Zhu-dse, Red-star, the Pole star, grandfather,<br />
10. Shoⁿ-ge A-ga-k’e e-goⁿ, Dog-star, Sirius, grandfather.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<p>The two wi&acute;-gi-es do not agree as to the sexes of two of the sky
deities. In the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge wi&acute;-gi-e, Ṭa-p̣a&acute; (Pleiades) is
addressed as grandmother and in that of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ as
grandfather. Ṭa-tha&acute;-bthiⁿ, Three-deer, is addressed as grandfather
in the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge wi&acute;-gi-e and in that of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-noⁿ as grandmother.</p>

<p>The difference between the two wi&acute;-gi-es in this respect was
spoken of to Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ and he said: “We notice such mistakes
in the tribal rites but controversy over them is always avoided by the
Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga. Xu-tha&acute;-wa-ṭoⁿ-iⁿ recited his wi&acute;-gi-e correctly,
and we recite ours as it was handed down to us. The Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-noⁿ, being a war people, mention in their wi&acute;-gi-e their two war
gods, the Red-star and the Dog-star; they address both as grandfather.
We (the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge) are a peace people, therefore
we do not mention those two gods in our child-naming ritual.”</p>

<p>The following is the first wi&acute;-gi-e in the Child-naming Ritual of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ, war gens, of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division, as
recited by Xu-tha&acute;-wa-ṭoⁿ-iⁿ.</p>

<p>The most important wi&acute;-gi-es (recited parts of a ritual) used in
the child-naming rituals are those which relate to the life symbols of a
gens, such as the sun, the moon, the morning and evening stars,
night and day, deer, elk, bear, etc., which are called wa-zho&acute;-i-ga-the,
objects of which bodies are made; and those which relate to the
personal, sacred names adopted by a gens to be used by its members
for their children. The wi&acute;-gi-e relating to the life symbols are
usually recited at the beginning of the ceremony. (See wi&acute;-gi-e of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens, p. 60.) The name wi&acute;-gi-es, called Zha&acute;-zhe
Ḳi-ṭoⁿ (Zha&acute;-zhe, name; Ḳi-ṭoⁿ, the taking of), are recited when all
the Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga who were invited to take part in the ceremony
of the conferring of a name upon a child have assembled. The life-symbol
and the name-taking wi&acute;-gi-es are paraphrases of the mythical
stories of the origin of the people of a gens. These mythical origin
stories are called Ni&acute;-ḳi-e, freely translated, Sayings of the Ancient
Men.</p>

<p>Xu-tha&acute;-wa-ṭoⁿ-iⁿ (pl. 7), of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ gens of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division, recorded the life symbol wi&acute;-gi-e of his
gens (see pp. 75-84) but he declined to give the wi&acute;-gi-e of the sacred
gens names. However, these names appear in the Wi&acute;-gi-e Ṭoⁿ-ga,
Great Wi&acute;-gi-e (36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 254-269),
which are here given in their order, as follows:</p>

<p>1. ’Iⁿ-&ccedil;ka&acute;, White Rock. In the origin story of this gens the
people came down from the sky, as eagles, to the earth and alighted
upon seven trees. Thence:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">36. They moved onward over the earth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">37. They came to the top of a rocky cliff,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">40. They spake to one another, saying: White Rock<br /></span>
<span class="i0">41. We shall make to be a personal name for ourselves.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="author">&mdash;(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 255.)</p>

<p>2. Moⁿ&acute;-hiⁿ Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da, Mysterious Knife. From the White
Rock the people went forth to wander over the earth. They thought
to make for themselves a knife for ceremonial use. The Sho&acute;-ḳa
went again and again to find the right kind of stone of which to make
the knife. He brought home the red flint, the blue flint, the flint
streaked with yellow, the black flint and the white flint, one after
the other, each of which was rejected as being unfit for use by the
little ones as a knife. Finally he brought home a round-handled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
knife which was accepted as suitable for the purpose. Then followed
the idea of the people of making a magical war club for ceremonial
use. The Sho&acute;-ḳa went in search for the right kind of tree out of
which to make it. He brought to the elder brothers the hickory
tree, the thick-barked hickory tree, the red oak tree, the red wood
tree, the dark wood tree, each of which was rejected as being unsuitable
for use as a club. Then he brought to them the willow tree, a
tree that never dies. This the elder brothers accepted as eminently
fitted for use as a club, and:</p>

<p>3. We&acute;-thiⁿ-&ccedil;a-gi, Strong-strap. With the mysterious knife the
people shaped out of the “tree-that-never-dies” a mystic club.
Taking with them the knife and the club they went in search of a
buffalo and found one. On coming in sight of the animal they
brandished the magic weapon four times in the air and the buffalo
fell lifeless to the ground:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">511. The skin of the (left) hind leg<br /></span>
<span class="i0">512. They cut into a narrow strip,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">514. And said: Verily the skin stretches not,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">515. We shall make use of it as we travel the path of life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">517. Verily, it is a strong strap,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p class="author">&mdash;(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 267-268.)</p>

<p>4. We&acute;-thiⁿ-ga-xe, Strap-maker. By the cutting of the first
strap out of the skin of the left hind leg of the magically killed buffalo
the people of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ gens created for themselves the
office of making the straps (pl. 8) for the warriors for the tying of
captives when any are taken. As they continued to cut out the
strap they said:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">523. Strap-maker, also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">524. We shall make to be our sacred personal name.<br /></span>

<p class="author">&mdash;(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 268.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span></p>

<p>5. W&eacute;-thiⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga, Slender-strap. The strap they made out of
the skin of the left hind leg of the animal was long and slender, and
when they had finished it,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">526. They said: Slender-strap, also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">527. We shall make to be our sacred personal name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">549. The skin of the left side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">550. They cut in a circle,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">552. And seven slender straps<br /></span>
<span class="i0">553. They made of it for the Ṭsi-zhu who possesses seven fireplaces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">554. One for each fireplace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">556. And they said: We shall consecrate these straps for ceremonial use.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="author">&mdash;(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 268-269.)</p>

<p>These seven straps cut from the left side of the buffalo were to
serve as types for similar straps to be ceremonially made for each
of the other gentes of the tribe when about to go to war, to use in
tying captives.</p>

<p>6. He-thi&acute;-shi-zhe, Curved-horn. As the people saw the horns of
the buffalo they exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">558. Behold the left horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">559. We shall consecrate it for ceremonial use,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">562. We shall make to be our sacred personal name.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="author">&mdash;(36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 269.)</p>

<p>7. He-thi&acute;-zha-ge, Outspread-horns. The people noticed that the
horns of the buffalo stood wide apart and outspread and so they exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">564. Outspread-horns, also,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">565. We shall make to be our sacred personal name.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">566. And they said, again: Behold the left horn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">568. We consecrete it for ceremonial use.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Personal names relating to any of the life symbols of a gens serve
to keep the members informed of their place in the gentile and tribal
organization. For example: Men who were given such names as
Ho-&ccedil;oⁿ&acute;, White-fish; To&acute;-ho-ho-e, Blue-fish; and Ho&acute;-ḳi-e-&ccedil;i, Wriggling-fish,
know that they are members of the Ho&acute;-i-ni-ḳa-shi-ga,
Fish-people, gens whose life symbol is the Fish, and that the place of
their gens is in the Wa-zha&acute;-zhe, the first of the two subdivisions of the
Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great tribal division which symbolizes the earth. The Wa-zha&acute;-zhe
subdivision typifies the water portion of the earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>Those who were given such names as O&acute;-poⁿ-ṭoⁿ-ga, Great-elk;
Moⁿ&acute;-thiⁿ-ḳa-ga-xe, Maker-of-the-land; and Moⁿ-zhoⁿ&acute;-ga-xe, Maker of-the-earth,
know that they are members of the Elk gens whose
life symbol is the male elk (36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn.,
p. 165, lines 274 to 354) and that the place of their gens is with the
Hoⁿ&acute;-ga, the second of the two subdivisions of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great
tribal division which symbolizes the earth. The Hoⁿ&acute;-ga subdivision
typifies the land portion of the earth.</p>

<p>Men who bear the names P̣i-&ccedil;i&acute;, Acorn; U-bu&acute;-dse, Profusion;
and Noⁿ-bu&acute;-dse, Profusion (by the treading of the eagles on the
branches of the red oak tree) know that they are members of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge (Peacemaker) gens, that the life symbol of
their gens is the red oak tree, the emblem of fruitfulness, and that
the place of their gens in the tribal organization is with the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu,
the second of the two great tribal divisions which symbolizes the
sky, including the sun, moon and stars that move therein. (See
36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., p. 281, lines 111 to 120.)</p>

the head, tail, and horns of the buffalo. No. 2a—the children of this subgens and those of the
Ni-ni&acute;-ba-toⁿ subgens of other gentes have their hair cut alike; the locks on each side of the bared crown
indicate the horns of the buffalo. No. 3 represents the line of the buffalo’s back as seen against the sky.
No. 4b stands for the head of the bear. No. 4c figures the head, tail, and body of small birds. No. 4d,
the bare head, represents the shell of the turtle; and the tufts, the head, feet, and tail of the animal. No.
4e pictures the head, wings, and tail of the eagle. No. 5 symbolizes the four points of the compass connected
by cross lines; the central tuft points to the zenith. No. 6 represents the shaggy side of the wolf.
No. 7 indicates the horns and tail of the buffalo. No. 8 stands for the head and tail of the deer. No. 9
shows the head, tail, and knobs of the growing horn of the buffalo calf. No. 10 symbolizes reptile teeth.
The children of this gens sometimes have the hair shaved off so as to represent the hairless body of snakes.</p>

<h3 id="The_gentile_hair_cut_of_children"><span class="smcap">The Gentile Hair Cut of Children</span></h3>

<p>Another custom, akin to the taking of personal gentile names, was
originated by the ancient Noⁿ&acute;-hoⁿ-zhiⁿ-ga, that of the adoption by
each of the various gentes of the tribe of a particular style of hair
cut for the young children to typify one of the life symbols of the
gens. (Fig. 5.) The style adopted by the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga gens of the
Hoⁿ&acute;-ga tribal subdivision for their children was that of cutting
nearly all the hair of the head close to the skin, leaving an unbroken
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
fringe along the entire edge. (Fig. 6.) The story of its adoption
is best told in the wi&acute;-gi-e of the gens, a paraphrase of which is here
given:</p>

<p>This style of hair cut is called ḳonⁿ&acute;-ha-u-thi-stse (ḳoⁿ&acute;-ha, along

<p>At a festival being held at the Indian village near the town of
Pawhuska, old Saucy-calf called the writer’s attention to a little boy
who was playing hide-and-seek with other youngsters and said:
“Look at the way his hair is cut (fig. 6); that is the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga A-hiu-ṭoⁿ
hair cut. That style is called ḳoⁿ&acute;-ha-u-thi-stse.
Xu-tha&acute;-pa, Eagle-head, better known
as Ben Wheeler, a young man who sat near
us, looked up and said: “That’s my little boy;
I cut my children’s hair like that.” Saucy-calf
then explained that the act of the parents in
cutting the hair of the child in that prescribed
fashion was an implied petition to
Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da to permit the little one to live to
see old age without obstruction of any kind.</p>

</div>

<p>The people of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge
(Peacemaker) gens, who occupied the most
important and honored place in the great tribal division representing
the sky and all that it contains, adopted the ḳoⁿ&acute;-ha-u-thi-stse
style of hair cut for their little ones, which varied slightly from the
styles used by the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga.
In the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge
symbolic hair cut
the line of hair left uncut
along the edge is divided
into little locks to typify
the petals of the cone-flower,
which is the sacred
flower of the gens (fig. 7).</p>

<p>Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, in
speaking of the symbolic
hair cut of the children of
his gens, the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu
Wa-shta-ge, told the following
mythical story of
its origin:</p>

<p>In the beginning the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu people came
down, in the form of
eagles, from the upper to the lower world. As they came in sight of
the earth they beheld a large red oak tree. They soared down to it
and alighted upon its topmost branches. The shock of their weight
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
sent to the ground a shower of acorns which scattered around the
foot of the tree, whereupon they said: We shall make of this tree
our life symbol; our little ones shall multiply in numbers like the
seeds of the oak that fall to the earth in countless numbers. The
eagles that crowded upon the top branches of the oak became a
people whose thoughts dwelt upon war, but two of the eagles found
no resting place on the outspreading branches of the great oak and
were obliged to drop to the earth. One alighted on a larger elder tree
and his people became known as Ba&acute;-po, people of the elder tree.
The other eagle alighted upon the ground in the midst of a patch of
little yellow flowers which his people made to be their life symbol
and their emblem of peace. The people cut the hair of their children
in such fashion as to make their heads resemble the little yellow
flower, the emblem of peace. (Fig. 7.) This yellow flower is
called Ba-shta&acute;, Hair-cut. It is the <i>Ratibida columnaris</i>.</p>

<p>A paraphrase of the wi&acute;-gi-e of the Xu-tha&acute;-zhu-dse, Red Eagle,
gens in which the “little yellow flower,” the emblem of peace, is
mentioned, is here given.</p>

<p>Ṭoⁿ-woⁿ-i&acute;-hi-zhiⁿ-ga, Little Ṭoⁿ-woⁿ-i&acute;-hi, in speaking to Miss
Fletcher in 1898 of the Osage gentile system, said that there are
five subgentes in the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens, namely:</p>

<p>1. Ṭsi&acute;-u-&ccedil;koⁿ-&ccedil;ka, House in the center, meaning the Sanctuary
in the keeping of this gens which, figuratively, stands in the center
of the earth.</p>

<p>2. Ba&acute;-po, Elder, or, People of the elder trees.</p>

<p>3. Moⁿ&acute;-&ccedil;a-hi, Arrow-tree, or, People of the arrow tree.</p>

<p>4. Zhoⁿ-&ccedil;oⁿ&acute;, White-tree (Sycamore), or, People of the white
tree.</p>

<p>5. Sho&acute;-ḳa, Messengers, or, People from whom a ceremonial
messenger is chosen for the gens. Sometimes this gens is called
Ṭsi&acute;-u-thu-ha-ge, Last group of houses.</p>

<p>It is from the people of the Ṭsi&acute;-u-&ccedil;koⁿ-&ccedil;ka that the hereditary
chief of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division must always be chosen.
The Ba&acute;-po subgens has the office of making the stem for the ceremonial
peace pipe of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge. The stem must
always be made of the Ba&acute;-po, the elder tree. The people of the
Arrow-tree and the Sycamore gentes have lost the significance of
their life symbols. All of these five subgentes use the cone-flower
symbolic hair cut.</p>

<p>There is something pathetic in the passing away of these ancient
rites and customs which the Osage Indians had treasured from the
earliest times of their tribal existence. Joe Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ, like his
father, had respect and reverence for the religious thoughts of his
ancestors which they had expressed in symbols and rituals with ceremonial
forms and handed down. Joe had two little daughters
(pl. 9, <i>a</i>) upon whom he bestowed a large share of his affections. He
not only gave to each of them a sacred name of his gens, but, from
year to year, as they approached womanhood, he cut their hair to
typify the sacred flower of peace and happiness, an act which
implied a supplication to Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da to bless each little one with a
long and fruitful life. At the last symbolic hair cut the children had
reached school age and they willingly went to the house of learning.
The white children with whom they mingled hooted and jeered at
them for their strange hair cut and made them unhappy. When
they came home they told their father of their unkind treatment at
the school. The fond father quietly took a pair of shears and cut
away from each little head the symbolic locks.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>Little Ṭoⁿ-woⁿ&acute;-i-hi also stated that there was another style of
symbolic hair cut called &ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse-a-gthe, tails worn on the head,
which belongs to the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ, the principal war gens of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division, which he described as: All of the
hair of the head cut close but leaving uncut a row of three locks,
equidistant apart, beginning at the crown of the head and ending
near the edge of the hair at the back of the head. (Fig. 8.) This
style of hair cut symbolizes all animals of the dog family, including
the gray wolf, the coyote, and the domestic dog. It also symbolizes
a star called Shoⁿ&acute;-ge a-ga-ḳ’e e-goⁿ, Dog that lies suspended in the
sky (Sirius).</p>

<p>The Dog Star is mentioned in the Child-naming Wi&acute;-gi-e of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ gens, bearing the title Wa-zho&acute;-i-ga-the Wi&acute;-gi-e,
Taking of Life Symbols, given by Xu-tha&acute;-wa-ṭoⁿ-in. (See p. <a href="#Page_82">82</a>, sec.
10 of the wi&acute;-gi-e.)</p>

<p>Little Ṭoⁿ-woⁿ&acute;-i-hi said that the Wa-&ccedil;a-be-ṭoⁿ, Black Bear gens
of the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga great division, had a similar style of hair cut as that
of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ gens. Wa-xthi&acute;-zhi said
that the Puma gens also had the same style of hair
cut.</p>

Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-noⁿ and
Wa-&ccedil;a&acute;-be (Black
Bear) gentes</p>
</div>

<p>The symbolic hair cut of the Ni&acute;-ḳa Wa-ḳoⁿ-da-gi
gens, Men of Mystery, is: hair of the head all cut
close excepting a lock left uncut on the crown of the
head (pl. 10, <i>a</i>) and a lock at the back of the head
near the edge, which does not show in the picture.
The life symbol of this gens is the hawk and the
hair cut represents this raptorial bird which was
adopted by all of the gentes of both the Hoⁿ&acute;-ga
and the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal divisions as an emblem
of courage for their warriors.</p>

<p>The name of the boy whose picture shows the hair cut of his gens is
Gthe-doⁿ&acute;-&ccedil;ka, White-hawk (Gthe-doⁿ, hawk; &ccedil;ka, white). It is the
name that belongs to the second son in a family of this gens. His
father’s name is Noⁿ&acute;-ḳa-ṭo-ho, Blue-back (Noⁿ&acute;-ḳa, back; ṭo-ho,
blue), a name referring to the blue-backed hawk. White-hawk’s
mother is Xi-tha&acute;-doⁿ-wiⁿ, Good-eagle-woman, daughter of Shoⁿ&acute;-ge-moⁿ-iⁿ
of the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wa-shta-ge gens.</p>

<p>The style of symbolic hair cut adopted by the Tho&acute;-xe gens is of
the &Ccedil;iⁿ&acute;-dse A-gthe class and is described as, hair on entire head cut
close excepting a little tuft left uncut just over the middle of the
forehead, and a fringe running across the crown of the head from one
ear to the other as shown in the picture (pl. 10, <i>b</i>); two tufts, one on
either side of the head back of the fringe, and a tuft just above the
nape of the neck, which do not show in the picture. This style of cut
represents the buffalo bull, the principal life symbol of the gens.</p>

<p>The two gentes, the Ni&acute;-ḳa Wa-ḳoⁿ-da-gi and the Tho&acute;-xe, are
closely related, being joint custodians of the rites pertaining to war.
(See 36th Ann. Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 64-65.) The symbolic
hawks, each of which formed the central figure in the ceremonies of
the war rites, were regarded as being in the special care of the Ni&acute;-ḳa
Wa-ḳoⁿ-da-gi, while all of the thirteen o-doⁿ&acute;, military honors, to be
won by each warrior of the tribe in order to secure ceremonial rank,
belonged to the Tho&acute;-xe. The war honor must be won in a fight by a
war party carrying a hawk, the tribal emblem of courage. The places
of these two gentes are on the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu side of the two great tribal
divisions, but they are not of the seven fireplaces of that great division.</p>

<p>In the Ṭsi&acute;-zhu Wi&acute;-gi-e recited by Moⁿ-zhoⁿ-a&acute;-ḳi-da (36th Ann.
Rept. Bur. Amer. Ethn., pp. 277-285), relating to the mythical story
of the descent of the people from the upper to the lower world, these
two gentes are mentioned. A paraphrase of this part is here given:</p>

<p>At the time this work was begun the greater portion of the Osage
people had practically ceased to observe the ancient custom of
cutting the hair of their children in the prescribed symbolic fashion,
and those who continued the practice were reluctant to speak of it
on account of its sacred and mysterious character. For this reason
it was not possible to make an exhaustive study of the hair cut of
the various gentes of the tribe. In the days when the rite was
generally and strictly observed the girl, when she had attained the
age of ten, was permitted to let her hair grow long, and the boy was
allowed to wear his hair in the same style as that of all the grown
men; that is, all the hair of the head cut close excepting a crest
beginning at the middle of the crown and terminating with a long
braided tail called he-ga&acute;-xa, horn, that hangs down the back of the
head and on the shoulder. (Pl. 11.) The braided tail is called
“a&acute;-&ccedil;ku” by the Omaha and the Ponca Indians.</p>

<p>The Ponca and the Omaha, who were at one time a part of the
Osage tribe, also had the same tribal custom of ceremonially cutting
the hair of the children. The ritual used in the ceremony is a supplication
to Wa-ḳoⁿ&acute;-da to favor the child with a long and fruitful life.</p>

<p>In the course of her ethnological work among the Omahas in the
years 1881-83, Miss Alice C. Fletcher undertook to gather information
about the symbolic hair cut of the children of that tribe.
At first she made slow progress because the Indians were unwilling
to speak of matters that form a part of the tribal rites. One day, at
the house of Xo&acute;-ga, the members of the family and some visitors
were speaking of Miss Fletcher’s difficulty in gathering information
about the hair cut, when the old man caught his little boy and,
holding him fast between his knees, proceeded to cut his hair. The
little fellow fought manfully but in a short time he stood with his
head closely sheared, with locks left uncut here and there. The
father swung the boy to his back and as he started to go he said:
“That white woman is my friend and I am going to help her.” He
carried the child to Miss Fletcher and as he put him down before
her he said, “That’s the hair cut of our gens. (See fig. 5, No. 2.)
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
It is the picture of a bison; you can’t see it [the bison] but we can.
You may make a sketch of it and write about it as much as you like.”
The lady looked for a moment in silence at the locks and the little
shorn head, then, with a hearty laugh and a handclap, she snatched
up paper and pencil to make a sketch of the locks and the shorn
head, to the delight of all the Indians present. Thereafter she had
no trouble in getting information about the hair cut of all the gentes.</p>

<h3 id="Fondness_of_personal_adornment"><span class="smcap">Fondness of Personal Adornment</span></h3>

<p>Like their relatives, the Omaha and the Ponca, the Osage people
have a fondness for personal adornment. Much paint is used in
decorating the face and body. Most of the lines and figures drawn
upon the face and body are symbolic, as, for instance, a woman paints
the parting of her hair almost daily. The red line symbolizes the
path of the sun which forever passes over the earth and gives to it
vitality. It is a sign of supplication for the continuity of life by
procreation. Or, a man of the Life-giver gens paints his face all
yellow with a narrow black line running diagonally across his face
from one corner of his forehead down to the lower jaw on the opposite
side. This is the life sign ceremonially put upon a captive when
the word is passed by the Life-giver gens that the captive shall be
permitted to live. A downy feather worn upright on the crown of
the head by a man symbolizes the sun which brings life to the earth
in material form. The white shell gorget which a man wears as a
pendant on his necklace is also a symbol of the life-giving sun.</p>

<h3 id="Ear_perforating"><span class="smcap">Ear Perforating</span></h3>

<p>Down to recent times the Osage men have been sacrificing the
shapeliness of their external ears to the gratification of their fondness
for adornment. In ordinary times, and particularly on festal days,
the Osage men weighted their ears with strings of wampum or other
ornaments made of bone or shells and silver earbobs which were
introduced by traders. The weight of the earrings and the crowding
of the holes in the ears with the rings enlarge the perforations to an
extraordinary size. (Pl. 11.) The holes, which are bored along the
rim of the pinna, were made by the same men who performed the
ceremony connected with the perforating. These men provided themselves
with perforating instruments made of sharpened bone, wooden
expanders, and little blocks of wood against which the ear is pressed
when performing the operation. (Pl. 12.) For a long time Wa&acute;-thu-xa-ge
and Ṭsi&acute;-zhu-zhiⁿ-ga held this office. The former died a few
years ago. Both of these men were members of the Peace gens of the
Ṭsi&acute;-zhu great tribal division. An Osage was asked why the ears
of the children were bored and he replied that the children whose
ears were bored were apt to be better behaved than those whose
ears were not perforated.
